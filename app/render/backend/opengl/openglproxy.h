  /**
   * @brief Initialize OpenGL instance in whatever thread this object is a part of
   *
   * This function creates a context (shared with share_ctx provided in the constructor) as well as various other
   * OpenGL thread-specific objects necessary for rendering. This function should only ever be called from the main
   * thread (i.e. the thread where share_ctx is current on) but AFTER this object has been pushed to its thread with
   * moveToThread(). If this function is called from a different thread, it could fail or even segfault on some
   * platforms.
   *
   * The reason this function must be called in the main thread (rather than initializing asynchronously in a separate
   * thread) is because different platforms have different rules about creating a share context with a context that
   * is still "current" in another thread. While some implementations do allow this, Windows OpenGL (wgl) explicitly
   * forbids it and other platforms/drivers will segfault attempting it. While we can obviously call "doneCurrent", I
   * haven't found any reliable way to prevent the main thread from making it current again before initialization is
   * complete other than blocking it entirely.
   *
   * To get around this, we create all share contexts in the main thread and then move them to the other thread
   * afterwards (which is completely legal). While annoying, this gets around the issue listed above by both preventing
   * the main thread from using the context during initialization and preventing more than one shared context being made
   * at the same time (which may or may not actually make a difference).
